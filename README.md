### This is a simple Ecommerce Ruby on Rails Back-end project developed for study purpose.

### That is a simple but very powerfull project and i tried to use the best developments, git and clean code practices.

### I performed the entire development flow, from the entity diagrams to the code itself to get as close as possible to a real project.
